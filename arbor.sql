Like the previous editions, this edition of Digital Design supports a multimodal approach to learning, with a focus on digital design, regardless of language. Recognizing that three public-domain languages Verilog, VHDL and System Verilog all play a role in design flows for today‚Äôs digital devices, the book offers parallel tracks of presentation of multiple languages.', ',', 5, 657, 0);

These techniques provide a competitive advantage over purely hardware or software implementations of time-constrained embedded systems. Recent advances in chip-level synthesis have made it possible to synthesize application-specific circuits under strict timing constraints. This work advances the state of the art by formulating the problem of system synthesis using both application-specific as well as reprogrammable components, such as off-the-shelf processors. Timing constraints are used to determine what part of the system functionality must be delegated to dedicated application-specific hardware while the rest is delegated to software that runs on the processor. This co-synthesis of hardware and software from behavioral specifications makes it possible to realize real-time embedded systems using off-the-shelf parts and a relatively small amount of application-specific circuitry that can be mapped to semi-custom VLSI such as gate arrays. The ability to perform detailed analysis of timing performance provides the opportunity of improving the system definition by creating better phototypes. Co-Synthesis of Hardware and Software for Digital Embedded Systems is of interest to CAD researchers and developers who want to branch off into the expanding field of hardware/software co-design, as well as to digital system designers who are interested in the present power and limitations of CAD techniques and their likely evolution.', ',', 5, 3582, 0),
